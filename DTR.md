Project: Hang In There

Group Member Names: Drew Bradley and Gabrielle Joyce

Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):
* Check in questions (last 3 minutes of work):
  * Did you feel left behind during work today?
  * Were there any aspects of the code written today that you didn't understand?
  * How are you feeling about the project (the application, our collaboration, our goals)?
	
Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):
* Drew: Exploratory and excited to try new things
* Gabrielle: Pseudocoding, task-driven, time mangagement

How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:
* Segment each iteration into smaller pieces while still experimenting with new code we have not learned yet.
* Energy and motivation will be kept in check by focus and management.
* Communicate and respect boundaries.

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have? Make sure to discuss the remote questions above in regards to this section): Wednesday 1-3PM (revisit schedule), Thursday 4-5, Friday 8am-8:45am, Sat 8-10am, Sun 8-10am.


Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team? How will we communicate about our emotional and mental well-being with each other?): see Goals & Expectations!

Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement): 
* I want to be able to understand how to use JS to manipulate CSS/HTML.
* Develope confidence in knowledge of the technology and when to try new things.

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
* Whatever code happens, we will write together. Please do not work on this outside of our scheduled time.

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques): 
* Commit at a minimum of when each new function is created or every 25 minutes, whichever comes first.

Pomodoro Break Schedule:
* 25 on/ 5 off.

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
* Assume positive intent. Maintain professional communication.
* Drew gets a talking timer.

Additional Remote Considerations:
* Time zone difference! 
* Respect our agreed upon schedule.

Project management tools we will use (GitHub projects or Trello are popular tools):
* kanban
* GitHub Projects
* Pomodoro Timers
* Tuple

Day 1 Agenda: 
* [ ] Set up Tuple
